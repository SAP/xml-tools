# Contribution Guide

This is the common top level contribution guide for this mono-repo.
A sub-package **may** have an additional CONTRIBUTING.md file if needed.

## Legal

All contributors must sign the DCO

- https://cla-assistant.io/SAP/xml-tools

This is managed automatically via https://cla-assistant.io/ pull request voter.

## Development Environment

### pre-requisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) >= 1.4.2
  - Yarn rather than npm is needed as this mono-repo uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).
- A [maintained version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) of node.js
  - This package is targeted and tested on modern/supported versions of node.js only.
    Which means 8/10/12/13 at the time of writing this document.
- [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#installing-the-command-line-tool) for managing commit messages.

### Initial Setup

The initial setup is trivial:

- clone this repo
- `yarn`

### Committing Changes

Use `git cz` to build conventional commit messages.

- requires [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#installing-the-command-line-tool) to be installed.

### Formatting.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to ensure consistent code formatting in this repository.
This is normally transparent as it automatically activated in a pre-commit hook using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
However this does mean that dev flows that do not use a full dev env (e.g editing directly on github)
may result in voter failures due to formatting errors.

### Testing

[Mocha][mocha] is used for unit-testing and [Istanbul/Nyc][istanbul] for coverage reports.
Jest was avoided due to increased total tests execution time due to running the tests in multiple processes,
as the Parser initialization (which happens once per process) can take 10-20ms.

[mocha]: https://mochajs.org/
[istanbul]: https://istanbul.js.org/

- To run the tests run `yarn test` in either the top level package or a specific subpackage.
- To run the tests with a coverage report run `yarn coverage:run` in either the top level package or a specific subpackage.

### Test Snapshots Updating

Several packages in this mono-repo use a snapshot testing methodology similar to the one used [in Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing).
Except that in our use case we test serialized data structures related to XML rather then the DOM, e.g:

- Expected Serialized XML CST.
- Expected Serialized XML AST.
- Expected Formatted XML Text.

Packages which utilize the snapshot testing methodoly will have a `snapshots:update` script in their package.json

- To update all the snapshots run: `yarn snapshots:update`.
- The above script is also needed when adding a new test case input and creating it initial expected value.

Obviously we should not blindly update the snapshots to make the tests pass.
Instead every change(diff) in the snapshots must be **manually reviewed** to assert that no unexpected changes
have occurred to the expected output...

### Test Coverage

100%\* Test Coverage is enforced for all productive code in this mono repo.

- Specific statements/functions may be [excluded][ignore_coverage] from the report but the reason for that must
  specified in the source code.

For example:

```javascript
/* istanbul ignore else - Defensive Coding, not actually possible else branch */
if (ctx.Name !== undefined && ctx.Name[0].isInsertedInRecovery !== true) {
  const keyToken = ctx.Name[0];
  astNode.key = keyToken.image;
  astNode.syntax.key = toXMLToken(keyToken);
}
```

### Full Build

This project does not use any compilation step (Babel/TypeScript), this means that the full build
does not generate any artifacts for runtime.

- To run the full **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration build run `yarn ci` in in either the top level package or a specific subpackage.

### Release Life-Cycle.

This monorepo uses Lerna's [independent][lerna-mode] mode support a separate life-cycle (version number)
for each package and automatically generate the changelog by adhering to [Conventional Commits][cc]

[lerna-mode]: https://github.com/lerna/lerna#independent-mode
[cc]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

### Release Process

Performing a release requires push permissions to the repository.

- Ensure you are on `master` branch and synced with origin.
- `yarn run release:version`
- Follow the lerna CLI instructions.
- Track the `RELEASE` tag build on circle-ci.
  - https://circleci.com/gh/SAP/xml-tools.
- Once the tag build has finished successfully inspect the npm registry to see the new versions
  for all the changed packages of this mono-repo.
  - `npm view [package-name] version`
