# @xml-tools/content-assist

APIs which assist in implementing content assist (auto-complete) logic for XML.
This package handles the identification of the specific content assist **scenario and context**.
Given this scenario & context information a user of this package can then implement
their custom content assist logic.

For example:

Given the following XML and a content assist request at the `⇶` sign:

```xml
<note>
  <address city="New ⇶"/>
  <to/>
  <from/>
</note>
```

A **Attribute Value** content assist scenario would be identified.
With a **prefix** `New` and references to the ASTNodes
of the relevant attribute(city) and the containing element (address).

- Note that an ASTNode possesses a `parent` property, so the full structure is accessible.

## Installation

With npm:

- `npm install @xml-tools/content-assist`

With Yarn

- `yarn add @xml-tools/content-assist`

## Usage

Please see the [TypeScript Definitions](./api.d.ts) for full API details.

A simple usage example:

```javascript
const { getSuggestions } = require("xml-tools/content-assist");

const xmlText = `<note>
                     <to>Bill</to>
                     <ad
                     <from>Bill</to>
                 </note>
`;
const suggestions = getSuggestions({
  text: xmlText,
  offset: 66, // Right after the '<ad` element start.
  providers: {
    // 1. There are more types(scenarios) of suggestions providers (see api.d.ts)
    // 2. Multiple providers may be supplied for a single scenario.
    elementName: [
      ({ element, prefix }) => {
        const suggestions = [];
        if (element.parent.name === "note" && "address".startsWith(prefix)) {
          suggestions.push({
            text: "address".slice(prefix.length),
            label: "address"
          });
        }
        return suggestions;
      }
    ]
  }
});

console.log(suggestions[0].text); // -> dress
```
